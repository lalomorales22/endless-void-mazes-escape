Welcome to your TRON-inspired 3D Database Interface! This application provides a unique, immersive way to visualize and interact with your database.

## About The Project

This project renders your database schema as a 3D landscape. Each table is represented as a "building" that you can navigate to. You can see table details, record counts, and even create new tables directly from the 3D interface.

### Key Features:

*   **3D Database Visualization:** Navigate a futuristic city where buildings represent your database tables.
*   **Interactive UI:** Click on buildings to view table details, and use the HUD to get an overview of your database status.
*   **Create Tables:** Dynamically add new tables to your database through the in-app interface.
*   **Real-time Data:** The interface reflects the current state of your database.

## How to Use

*   **Navigate:** Use `WASD` or `Arrow Keys` to move around the 3D world.
*   **Rotate View:** Click and drag your mouse to look around.
*   **Zoom:** Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
*   **Select a Table:** Click on a "Database Building" on the right-side panel, or click on a building in the 3D view to navigate to it.
*   **Create a Table:** Click the "CREATE TABLE" button or press the `Spacebar` to open the table creation dialog.
